This file provides the description and understanding of the different codesof the final output file i.e tidy data set.txt created as part of the Course assignment for "Getting & Cleaning Data" -Part of the Coursera Data Science Specialization.

The raw data was loaded into the R from the Project subdirectory in the wokrking directory

The raw data for creating this tidy data set was based on the experiments that has  been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 

The tidy data set has the average  of 79 variables for 30 subjects carrying out 6 activities .The following codes describes the activities ,Subjects and variables

Activities -labeled as 

 WALKING
 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
 SITTING
 STANDING
 LAYING
 
 Subects are  labeled as
 
 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30
 
the list of 79 variables (listed below) are the average of the 79 variable means and standard deviations(std) . the interpreatation of the variable code is t(for time) ;f (for Fast Fourier Transform) ,x ,y and z - represents 3 axis for observations .The observations captured by accelerometer and gyroscope  are represented by acc and gyro .

 The resulting dataset is 180 rows (30subjects * 6 activities) -  81 columns (79 observations variable + 1 for subject id and 1 for activity id)
